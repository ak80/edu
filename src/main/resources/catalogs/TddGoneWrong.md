# TDD, where did it all go wrong

## Questions to ask

* Why do many developers don't want to write tests? They can't all be idiots!
* Why do tests break when we change implementation details, or merely refactor?
* Why do we have so many tests?
* Why are lean folks abandoning test first?

The short answer is, we are doing TDD wrong, Kent Beck tried to teach us how but we got him wrong. 
We should all return to his book "Test Driven Development: By Example".
